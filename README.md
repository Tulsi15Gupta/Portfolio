Personal Portfolio Website
A modern and fully responsive Portfolio Website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This portfolio showcases my skills, projects, education, and contact details in a clean and user-friendly layout. The design focuses on simple UI/UX, smooth animations, and full mobile responsiveness. It includes a responsive layout that adapts smoothly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens using flexible CSS grids and media queries. The project section highlights all major work with titles, descriptions, and links in an easy-to-read card layout. The overall UI maintains a minimalistic style with consistent colors, smooth transitions, and appealing hover effects. JavaScript adds interactive functionality such as smooth scrolling navigation, animated buttons, form validation, and a sticky navigation bar for better usability.
